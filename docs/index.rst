PDUQ, or Phase Diagram Uncertainty Quantification, is a tool
to quantify the uncertainty of thermochemistry and phase stability
predictions from the CALPHAD methodology. PDUQ relies on
`pycalphad <https://pycalphad.org/docs/latest/>`_ for property
prediction and `ESPEI <http://espei.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ for
Bayesian samples from the posterior CALPHAD parameter distributions.
